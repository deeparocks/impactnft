# Impact Protocol for Impact NFTs

* An open source, decentralized protocol that defines Impact NFTs 
* Impact NFTs are tokens awarded to people who have contributed towards causes
* Impact NFTs are a proof of impact issued by nonprofits to those making an impact
* Our goal is to make adoption of impact NFTs easy for nonprofits
* Impact NFTs will be an important part of our online identities, one that signals "that you care"

# Why Impact NFTs

NFTs are online certificates of authenticity and ownership. They present the strengths of blockchain (public ledger, permanence, decentralization) in a visual, digital format that is easy to store and display. The digital arts community was the first to leverage NFTs, however the scope of NFTs have evolved from its initial usage and are disrupting almost every industry. In the events and meetup space, they are proof of attendance NFTs, event organizers issue NFTs to attendees as a proof that the NFT holder attended the event. In the social good sector Impact NFTs will serve as a "proof of giving" issued by nonprofits in exchange for donating time and money. Impact NFTs will help filter the doers from the talkers. 

# The problem 

Social Media has given people a platform to talk about the issues they care about. People like, retweet stuff about the causes they care most but often social media actions lacks real commitment and action towards the cause. Termed as Slacktivism its a lazy attempt to show you care without taking real action.

# The solution

Imapct NFTs fix slacktivisim. Impact NFTs will highlight and reward the doers by serving as a proof of giving certificate, publicly verifiable and immutable. Twitter now allows NFTs to be displayed as profile pictures thus indentifying the user as the owner of the NFT. There is news that Meta might do the same for Facebook and Instagram. Displaying Impact NFTs as profile pictures will let people show off their charitable side. As people continue to live more of their lives online, they are looking for ways to create their online identity. The NFTs they hold are an expression of their online identity and impact NFTs will play a crucial role in the online identity composition. 

# Impact Protocol

The goal of the Impact Protocol is to make it easy for nonprofits to use Impact NFTs. The social good sector mostly lacks resources, money and artistic sophistication needed in the NFT space. 

## Create 
Good design is essential and most times nonprofits lack design expertise. Similar to Unsplash, the Impact Protocol will have a free to use collection of high quality artworks representing various causes. Creators donate artwork under a creative commons license with attribution. Nonprofits can use this artwork in their Impsct NFTs. Creatres are awarded with recognition and royaaltis if the NTF is sold ahead.

Initially the aim will be to create a collection of artwork around the 17 themes of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGSs). SDGs are identified by UN and considered as the "blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all people and the world by 2030"

## Mint

The Impact Protocol makes it easy for nonprofits to mint. Nonprofits do not need to have any technical knowhow to mint an Impact NFT. 

## Distribute

The Protocol will also make it easy for nonprofits to issue impact NFTs to its support base and to claim through multiple ways. 

The goal is to provide an end to end solution to social impact organizations (nonprofits, social enterprises and cause driven DAOs) to create, mint and distribute impact NFTs. The artwork gallery offers designs that social impact organizations can use off the shelf but the protocol will also provide the capability to customize. 

# A few examples

A nonprofit can issue NFTs to its donors and volunteers with an image that represents them or their work. The NFT description provides the details of why the NFT was issued.

A nonprofit can have multi tiered NFTs to recognize different levels of donors or volunteers. A dynamic NFT that evolves as levels of contributions go up. 

A social enterprise can recognize their loyal customers by issuing NFTs that depicts their ethos - fair wages, handmade, sustainable etc

NFTs for special campaigns. If a nonprofit organizes a fundraiser to build a school or a well in a particular place or to provide meals to x no of people, they can issues amn NFT that depicts and details the impact of this special campaign.

Impact NFTs can be resold with 100% or 85% of the monies going back to the creator (in this case the nonprofit)
